  (priority-preempt) Thread high-priority iteration 1
  (priority-preempt) Thread high-priority iteration 2
  (priority-preempt) Thread high-priority iteration 3
  (priority-preempt) Thread high-priority iteration 4
  (priority-preempt) Thread high-priority done!
  (priority-preempt) The high-priority thread should have already completed.
